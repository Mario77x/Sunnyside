## 1. About

Our lives are filled with digital tools, yet the joy of sharing real moments with family and friends remains unmatched. But today's digital landscape forces us to juggle multiple apps just to organize a simple get-together. Sunnyside empowers meaningful in-person connections by consolidating planning, personalized recommendations, and hyper-local weather into a single, seamless experience - making real life easier than digital distractions.

### Sunnyside Key Aspects
We want to foster IRL meetings with family & friends, offering activity planning and communication tools that incorporate personalized local recommendations based on individual preferences and availability, with the novel addition of hyper-local and real-time weather forecasting, consolidating activities currently happening across different surfaces into one single seamless flow.

We want to make it easy for people to find the right activity, right time, and right weather to meet family & friends. Our mission: **"Unforgettable moments made easy."**

## 2. Market Insights

Our app is positioned in the "social planning" category at the intersection of group scheduling, event discovery, and local leisure, with a clear IRL-first angle distinct from feed-based social media on one hand, and messaging apps with limited functionality on the other. Key adjacent categories are group scheduling/calendars, friendship/interest meetups, and local activities discovery.

As such, the market does not have any competitors that offer the specific combination of USPs we offer, though a few intersect quite close.

This leaves a clear gap for a consumer app that combines:
* A focus on IRL social life over digital content
* Automated group availability coordination
* Personalized local activity suggestions
* Real-time weather integration

### Competitor Analysis
* **Meetup and GroupSpot** are the closest in spirit but focus more on interest-based group formation and event discovery rather than personalized, weather-aware planning
* **Group scheduling tools** like Clockwise and Asana show strong demand for intelligent coordination but are mostly workplace-oriented and lack social or leisure activity focus
* **Direct scheduling apps** like Doodle/When2meet focus on group polling features but lack personalized suggestions or weather-aware features
* **Event management apps** (Localist, Guidebook, Swapcard) cater to professional or large-scale events, not casual social gatherings
* **Other event management apps** like Facebook Events prioritize local event discovery but are feature-light on group coordination, personalized suggestions, and do not include weather forecasting
* **Tools like WhatsApp/iMessage** group intersect in the coordination space but are focused on communication, do not focus on IRL meetings, lack activity suggestions, and do not include weather
* **Friendship and relationship apps** such as Bumble BFF et al. have a strong focus on people discovery but do not cover existing groups nor focus on activity planning
* **Weather apps** such as The Weather Channel focus on weather forecasts but have no recommendations, coordination nor personalized suggestions

### Key Insights
* Facebook Events dominates market share in the adjacent space (45%) but has only moderate satisfaction (6.5/10), indicating user frustration
* Niche leaders show potential: Clockwise and Meetup achieve higher satisfaction (8.0 and 7.5 respectively) but remain constrained by their narrow focus (B2B scheduling and community events)

### Market Analysis
We believe our approach aligns well with current consumer trends seeking more meaningful social experiences and less screen time, and reducing the complexity of digital apps by streamlining workflows and automating parts of it, offering a tool that helps them coordinate real-life interactions efficiently, overcoming challenges like app juggling, conflicting schedules, lack of ideas for activities, and unpredictable weather.

We aim to capture this trend by emphasizing:
* The emotional value of shared experiences
* The frustration with passive social media consumption
* The frustration of having to juggle many apps for one activity
* The practical barriers to organizing IRL meetups

### Key Differentiator
Sunnyside uniquely combines personalized group activity suggestions, real-time weather intelligence, and seamless scheduling, addressing consumer frustration with fragmented, generic, or workplace-focused tools. Unlike social media or messaging apps, Sunnyside is purpose-built for making real-life plans easy, personalized, and reliable.

### Strategic Implications
* **Growth trajectory:** The positioning suggests Sunnyside could follow a classic disruption path - start with superior user experience to capture satisfied early adopters, then scale to challenge incumbents
* **Attack vector:** We aim to target Facebook Events' dissatisfied users who want weather-aware, preference-driven activities integrated with planning coordination beyond generic event discovery

### Technology Analysis
The most important competitors in the space (eg. Facebook Events, WhatsApp Groups, The Weather Channel, Bumble, etc.) are well established and have massive tech advantages and resources, yet they do not focus on our niche nor particularly leverage the combination of smart features we propose.
The smaller competitors (GroupSpot, Clockwise, etc.) in the space have no particular tech advantages we cannot replicate or even outperform.

### Customer Segments
There are different segments that would benefit from a unified tool that blends IRL meeting, availability coordination, personalized local recommendations, and weather-aware planning without juggling multiple apps.

We could divide the segments into two distinct groups:
* Current relationship enhancement
* Social and friendship discovery

For the initial launch, we will focus on the first group, which aligns more closely with our value proposition. The group that falls into the "social and friendship discovery" could take us in a different direction and spread our resources and focus thinly. We will consider that group in further iterations.

### Focus Segments: Current Relationship Enhancement
1. **Young Urban Professionals**  
   Tech-savvy city dwellers juggling fast-paced careers and active social lives. They crave effortless coordination for after-work drinks, weekend brunches, or pop-up events-especially when weather conditions can make or break outdoor plans.

2. **Young Parents & Caregivers**  
   Families balancing schedules around school runs, nap times, and extracurriculars. They need playdate planning, family-friendly outing suggestions, and real-time weather prompts to choose between parks, playgrounds, or indoor activities.

3. **Extended Families & Social Circles**  
   Multigenerational relatives and friend groups spread across neighborhoods or cities. Sunnyside helps find mutually convenient times and locally relevant activities-holiday gatherings, casual reunions, or milestone celebrations-while adapting to local weather.

### Segments Left for Future Iterations: Social and friendship discovery
* **Community Organizers & Local Hosts**  
  Neighborhood hubs, small-scale event hosts, and micro-influencers curating local experiences. They use Sunnyside to manage RSVPs, surface group preferences, and lock in optimal event timing based on forecasted conditions.

* **Hobby & Activity Enthusiast Groups**  
  Niche communities-weekend hikers, cycling clubs, board-game circles, and book clubs-that regularly convene around shared passions. They value personalized local venues and weather-adjusted timing to make meetings reliable and enjoyable.

* **Travel & Leisure Seekers**  
  On-the-go explorers and business travelers who want impromptu social experiences. Leveraging Sunnyside's location-aware, weather-informed recommendations, they can turn layovers, hotel stays, or conference trips into memorable IRL meetups with locals or fellow travelers.

## 3. The Problem

### Use Cases & Pain Points
We ran interviews with our target personas to validate our idea and uncover insights. The resulting insights are summarized below.

#### 1) Alex - Young Urban Professional
**Age:** 29  
**Location:** Downtown Berlin  
**Job:** Marketing Manager at a tech startup

**Interview Insights:**
**Use Case:** "I want to grab drinks with my close friends after work, but coordinating with 4-6 people is a nightmare. Weather can completely kill outdoor rooftop plans."

**Current Process:**
1. Posts in friend WhatsApp group: "Drinks tonight?"
2. Gets mixed responses over 2-3 hours
3. Checks weather app separately
4. Googles "best happy hour spots near us"
5. Continues WhatsApp discussion to finalize location/time
6. Sends calendar invites manually

**Pain Points Discovered:**
* **Tool fragmentation:** "I'm jumping between WhatsApp, Google Maps, weather app, and my calendar"
* **Weather anxiety:** "Nothing worse than suggesting rooftop drinks when it starts raining"
* **Decision paralysis:** "Everyone says 'I'm flexible' but no one actually decides"
* **FOMO coordination:** "By the time we figure it out, half the group has other plans"

**Unexpected Insight:** Alex actually coordinates 2-3 separate friend groups with different apps and processes-college friends (WhatsApp), gym buddies (Instagram DMs), neighborhood friends (Telegram). No unified system.

#### 2) Maria - Young Parent & Caregiver
**Age:** 34  
**Location:** Amsterdam  
**Job:** Part-time graphic designer, mother of 6-year-old

**Interview Insights:**
**Use Case:** "I need playdates for my daughter, but coordinating with other parents around school pickups, naps, and weather is like solving a puzzle."

**Current Process:**
1. Texts 3-4 parent friends individually
2. Checks school calendar for conflicts
3. Cross-references weather for playground vs. indoor activities
4. Creates parent WhatsApp group for final details
5. Sends reminder texts day-of

**Pain Points Discovered:**
* **Time-window anxiety:** "I have maybe 2-3 hour windows between school and dinner prep"
* **Weather contingency stress:** "I need Plan A (park) and Plan B (indoor play center) ready to go"
* **Individual coordination fatigue:** "Texting everyone separately takes forever"
* **Last-minute cancellations:** "Kids get sick, schedules change-I need flexibility"

**Unexpected Insights:**
* Maria coordinates with grandparents across cities for family visits, not just local parents
* Seasonal patterns: Different coordination needs for school holidays, summer break, rainy Amsterdam weather
* Energy management: "By Thursday, I'm too tired to organize weekend plans"

#### 3) Hassan - Extended Family & Social Circle
**Age:** 42  
**Location:** London suburbs  
**Job:** Operations manager, coordinates large family gatherings

**Interview Insights:**
**Use Case:** "I organize monthly family dinners for 12-15 people across London-parents, siblings, cousins, kids. Finding dates that work for everyone is impossible."

**Current Process:**
1. Creates Doodle poll with 3-4 weekend options
2. Follows up via family WhatsApp group
3. Calls resistant family members individually
4. Researches restaurants that accommodate large groups + kids
5. Checks weather for garden vs. indoor venues
6. Sends final details via email + WhatsApp

**Pain Points Discovered:**
* **Generational coordination gaps:** "My parents don't use Doodle, my nephews ignore WhatsApp"
* **Venue complexity:** "Need high chairs, parking, reasonable prices, and good food"
* **Weather impact on attendance:** "Older relatives won't come if it's rainy/cold"
* **Cultural food preferences:** "Need halal options, kid-friendly meals, dietary restrictions"

**Unexpected Insights:**
* Hassan coordinates 4 different family circles (immediate family, extended relatives, work colleagues, neighborhood friends) with completely different tools and communication styles
* Holiday amplification: Coordination stress 10x during Eid, Christmas, birthdays
* Geographic spread: Some family members travel 1+ hours, making weather/traffic crucial factors

### Key Insights

**Universal Pain Points Across All Segments:**
1. **Multi-tool fragmentation fatigue** - Everyone uses 3-6 different apps for a single coordination process
2. **Weather-activity disconnect** - Weather checking happens separately from venue selection
3. **Preference assumption vs. reality** - People say they're "flexible" but have hidden constraints
4. **Real-time coordination chaos** - Plans change dynamically, but tools are static

**Product Development Implications:**
1. **Integration over innovation** - Success comes from unifying existing behaviors, not creating new ones
2. **Weather-first planning** - Weather should drive activity suggestions, not be an afterthought
3. **Flexible group dynamics** - Support both tight friend circles and loose extended networks
4. **Backup plan architecture** - Build contingency planning into the core user flow
5. **Communication bridge** - Support multiple notification preferences within the same group (WhatsApp, email, SMS)

### Conclusion
These insights suggest Sunnyside should position itself as the "coordination layer" that sits above existing communication tools, rather than trying to replace them entirely.

**Product Design Implications:**
* Weather integration isn't a feature-it's anxiety relief
* Backup planning should be proactive, not reactive
* Success metrics should measure coordination reduction, not just plan creation
* Multi-generational tool bridges are essential for family segments

These empathy maps reveal that Sunnyside isn't just solving logistics-it's addressing emotional labor, anxiety, and social responsibility across different life contexts.

### Problem Statement
Alex, Maria and Hassan are frustrated and fatigued by the time and effort they spent for the simple reason of getting together with family and friends, juggling between apps, trying to get hold of everyone, finding the activity, place and time everyone would like, wondering if the activity will be ruined by bad weather, and often giving up altogether.

### Hypotheses and Mission Statement
By bringing Sunnyside to life, we will be making the organization of activities with friends & family easier and more enjoyable, we will be lifting the burden of having to juggle between apps to find the right activity, place, check weather, and communicate with invited people, reducing friction and frustration, and allowing people to focus on what matters most: enjoying unforgettable moments.

**Our mission: Unforgettable moments made easy.**

## 4. The Solution

### Ideation
Sunnyside leverages AI capabilities to find the right time, weather, and specific activities and places to go with family and friends based on availability and personal preferences, including handy multi-channel communication and notifications, reducing the need to juggle between apps, and allowing users to focus on what matters most: enjoying unforgettable moments with their loved ones.

### The PoC
* **Frontend-only implementation** for initial PoC - backend integrations will be mocked and implemented in the iteration right after, and once that done, we will complete the MVP for launch
* We will initially focus in the Netherlands, in order to reduce the complexity of data sources required to support activity recommendations and weather forecasts
* We will use a weather API to retrieve forecasts (mocked for MVP)
* We will offer users the ability to sync with their calendars (Google, Outlook, iCal) to find the best moments to meet, or default to manual input if no integration is chosen (mocked for MVP)
* We will use LLM with RAG to find and suggest the activities that match group preferences, considering weather forecast and availability (mocked for MVP)
* It will be web based
* It will have a simple chat-based interface that will ask users what they are planning to do and parse intent from there
* Will support English but create a Frontend architecture that supports further multi-lingual expansion (adding keys instead of hard-coding copy)
* It will be free, incorporating ads in a non-disruptive way, seamlessly integrated into the UX, seeking to display relevant advertisers related to the proposed activities
* It will include the ability to integrate with email, SMS and messaging apps such as WhatsApp in order to allow multi-channel communication (mocked for MVP)
* It will include the ability to send polls for dates and activities
* It will also include ability to define backup plans in case of bad weather
* * To support varying degrees of tech literacy, we will also have a simpler “guest” flow to allow users to participate in polls without the need to create their own account. Guest users will not be able to propose preferences, for that, they will need to create their own account. 
* We will also include notifications for different crucial aspects of the flow supporting both in-app and external notifications, including initially e-mail, SMS and other messaging channels the user might have integrated with in order to cover different types of use cases and tech literacy. 

### The MVP
* Review PoC and iron out any possible issues
* Add backend to create the fully functional MVP
* Publish MVP

### Iterations post MVP launch, not covered in the current roadmap
* Add Android and iOS mobile apps.
* Expand to the European markets based on potential revenue expansion.
* Kickstart a network of partnerships guided by data: by aggregating data from preferences in users’ profiles, we will be able to understand activity trends, and direct partnership efforts in that direction. Partners would appear as “Sponsored” in the suggestions, we can test the concept in the Netherlands, which has a highly developed digital ecosystem.
* Add Premium subscription to remove ads and add more features, covering even more apps currently used in the group activity planning workflow. Since we aim to tackle app juggling frustration as one of our main USPs, incorporating functionalities would be a logical vector to reinforce subscriptions. 
* Features targeted for Premium:
   * Add a more complex chat-based interface and voice support.
   * Add location awareness, and mobility preferences (eg. car, public transport, cycling) so that it can also find activities that are accessible to the whole group based on their location and preferred mobility to reach a venue.
   * Expand to cover social discovery use cases.
   * More integrations (Telegram, Signal, other types of calendars, etc.)
   * Photo sharing abilities with activity albums.
   * Cost sharing/splitting functionality.
   * Etc. 


### Leveraging AI
AI allows us to mix different data sources and offer targeted and personalized recommendations:
* Retrieve and analyze weather data.
* Retrieve availability from calendar or manual user input.
* Retrieve user activity preferences from profiles or manual input.
* Mix all the above to run online searches and suggest personalized activity recommendations in the area.


### AI MVP
We won’t be creating an AI/Model MVP, instead, we’ll leverage advanced language models and intent-parsing to translate brief user input into actionable plans, generating suggestions that combine hyper-local weather, preference profiles, and group availability. End users experience the results through a simple, chat-like prompt - laying groundwork for richer, conversational flows in future releases.

## 5. Requirements

### User Journeys
Our core philosophy is to start simple and add complexity gradually; we therefore focus our MVP on these key concepts: 
                        * Single entry point with progressive disclosure
                        * Guest mode as first-class citizen, not afterthought
                        * Weather-first approach (key differentiator)
                        * Leveraging AI for smart handling of user intent and smart suggestions (key differentiator)


### Detailed flow
                        1. Entry & Setup
                        1. New Users:

                        * Support smooth handling of multiple concurrent users requesting AI-powered suggestions without noticeable slowdowns.


                        2. Scalability  
                        * System design must allow seamless growth to tens of thousands of daily active users in the initial market.
                        * AI services, including any large-language-model calls, should automatically scale to meet demand.


                        3. Reliability & Availability  
                        * Target uptime of at least 99.9% for all core services (weather, AI, notifications).
                        * Provide fallback behavior if external services (weather API or AI engine) are temporarily unavailable, such as cached forecasts or simplified suggestions.

### AI & Data Requirements
Since we will only leverage existing LLMs, we do not need specific data requirements.
We do need to make sure the chat parser for intent, and the prompt to generate recommendations  delivers value for users. 
We will evaluate accuracy of response manually in the MVP and then incorporate a specific metric (see Measuring Success).


### Integration with LLM
Step-by-step list for integrating an LLM (like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Azure OpenAI, or similar) into the app:


                        1. Define what the LLM should do
                        * Example: “Parse free-text user input to extract intent, suggest activities considering preferences and weather, generate friendly prompts for users.”
   
                        2. Design of the data flow
                        * User enters input in the app (e.g., “Let’s do something outdoors this Saturday”)
                        * The frontend sends this input to the backend server


                        3. Backend constructs the LLM prompt
                        * The backend adds any needed context (e.g., user preferences, calendar, weather data)
                        * It prepares a prompt for the LLM (e.g., “The user said: … Their location is Amsterdam. Weather forecast: … Preferences: … Suggest an activity.”)
                        * The prompt should add that the input should be checked for any potential harmful activities, and in that case, the LLM should reject it. Eg. Any activities threatening the public order, the life of others, have any harmful intent for themselves or others, in which case, the response sent to the frontend would be “That seems risky, have you thought about a barbecue with friends or a movie with the daily?” 


                        4. Backend sends the prompt to the LLM API
                        * The backend makes an API request to the LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Azure)
                        * The request includes the full prompt as a variable (string of text)


                        5. LLM returns results
                        * The LLM responds with its output (e.g., suggested activities, parsed intent, or a friendly message)
                        * If the input was considered harmful or threatening, the response should be “That seems risky, have you thought about a barbecue with friends or a movie with the daily?”


                        6. Backend processes and returns results to the frontend
                        * Backend translates LLM output into app-specific objects (activity list, date suggestions, messages)
                        * Backend sends this structured data back to the frontend UI


                        7. Frontend displays personalized suggestions to the user
                        * User sees the suggestions and continues with the next step in the flow
                        * If the input was considered harmful or threatening, the response should not include any suggestions, and only a reply “That seems risky, have you thought about a barbecue with friends or a movie with the daily?”. In this case, the user will be given the choice to satrat the process over.




## 6. Challenges
Since we do not create our own AI/Model, the only concerns we have are:
                        * Finding enough advertisement to cover the costs during the first months, while we validate the hypothesis.
                        * The reliability of the free data we will fetch through the API from the Royal Dutch Institute of Meteorology (KNMI), which offers forecasts only for the coming 6 days.
                        * Nailing the LLM integration and the resulting recommendations.

                        * Weekly Retention Rate (D1, D7, D30) - to gauge stickiness beyond one-day use.
                        * Invite Acceptance Rate - % of invites that receive a yes/maybe response, measuring RSVP flow effectiveness.
                        * NPS


### Technical Metrics
                        * System Uptime - target ≥99.9%.
                        * Error Rate - keep <1% of requests failing.
                        * Average Page Load/Response Time - aim for <300 ms for core interactions.
                        * LLM Error Rate (e.g., parsing failures or low-confidence responses) - to flag quality issues early.
                        * Third-Party API SLA Compliance - % of weather/notification calls meeting SLA, to monitor external dependencies.


### AI-specific Metrics
Since we do not have a proprietary model, nor we tweak an existing, the most important metrics to consider in this section are:
                        * LLM Response Latency - monitor median and 95th percentile to ensure predictability.
                        * LLM Accuracy - measured via periodic human review ratings (e.g., % of suggestions rated “relevant” or better).
                        * Recommendation Adoption Rate - % of AI suggestions that organizers select.
                        * Feedback-Adjusted Accuracy - tracks improvement in accuracy over time by comparing initial suggestions vs. post-event feedback.


### North Star Metric
Our North Star Metric is the “Daily Activities Created” because it hits the core value the app promises to deliver.
