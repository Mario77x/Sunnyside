## Phase 2: Short-term Tasks (Next 1-2 Sprints) - Implement Core AI Features

**Goal**: Implement AI-powered features to enhance user experience and automate activity planning.

**Status**: 🔄 Partially Complete (2/3 features implemented)

**Complexity**: Medium (reduced due to existing implementations)

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks (remaining work)

### 2.1 Intent Parsing

**Goal**: Allow users to describe activities in natural language and automatically extract structured data.

**Status**: ✅ Backend Complete, 🔄 Frontend Enhancement Needed

| Task | File | Status | Complexity | Notes |
|------|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Develop NLP service for intent parsing | [`backend/services/llm.py`](backend/services/llm.py) | ✅ Complete | High | Implemented with Mistral AI |
| Create intent parsing endpoint | [`backend/routes/llm.py`](backend/routes/llm.py) | ✅ Complete | Medium | Fully functional endpoint |
| Add natural language input field | [`frontend/src/pages/CreateActivity.tsx`](frontend/src/pages/CreateActivity.tsx) | 🔄 Partial | Low | Basic integration exists |
| Implement form auto-population | [`frontend/src/pages/CreateActivity.tsx`](frontend/src/pages/CreateActivity.tsx) | 🔄 Partial | Medium | Needs enhancement to use all parsed data |
| Admin testing component | [`frontend/src/components/IntentParser.tsx`](frontend/src/components/IntentParser.tsx) | ✅ Complete | Low | Admin-only testing interface |

**Current Implementation**: Backend fully implemented with Mistral AI. Frontend has basic integration but doesn't fully utilize all parsed intent data for form auto-population.

**Example Use Case**: User types "Let's go hiking this Saturday morning in the mountains" → System extracts activity type (hiking), date (Saturday), time (morning), location preference (mountains).

### 2.2 Activity Recommendations

**Goal**: Suggest personalized activities based on user preferences, location, and weather conditions.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Full Implementation with RAG Approach

| Task | File | Status | Complexity | Notes |
|------|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Create recommendation engine | [`backend/services/llm.py`](backend/services/llm.py) | ✅ Complete | High | RAG implementation with DuckDuckGo web search |
| Build recommendation endpoint | [`backend/routes/llm.py`](backend/routes/llm.py) | ✅ Complete | Medium | Fully functional with risk assessment |
| Design recommendations UI | [`frontend/src/components/RecommendationGenerator.tsx`](frontend/src/components/RecommendationGenerator.tsx) | ✅ Complete | Medium | Complete frontend integration |
| Integrate with user preferences | [`backend/models/user.py`](backend/models/user.py) | ✅ Complete | Low | Integrated in recommendation flow |
| Risk assessment integration | [`backend/services/risk_assessment.py`](backend/services/risk_assessment.py) | ✅ Complete | Medium | Content safety filtering |

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ Weather-based suggestions
- ✅ Location-aware recommendations via web search
- ✅ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach
- ✅ Real-time venue data via DuckDuckGo search
- ✅ Content safety filtering
- ✅ Full activity creation workflow integration

**Technical Implementation**: Uses Mistral AI with RAG approach, combining web search results with LLM processing for accurate, up-to-date venue recommendations.

### 2.3 Smart Scheduling

**Goal**: Automatically suggest optimal times for activities based on participant availability.

**Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED - Only Missing Core AI Feature

| Task | File | Status | Complexity | Dependencies |
|------|------|--------|------------|--------------|

| Integrate with Google Calendar | Various files | ❌ Not Started | High | Phase 3 Google Calendar work |

**Planned Features**:
- Conflict detection
- Optimal time suggestions
- Multi-participant scheduling

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **Mistral AI API Integration**
   - **Risk**: API rate limits, costs, reliability
   - **Mitigation**: ✅ Implemented with usage monitoring, ✅ RAG approach reduces API calls
   - **Status**: Currently operational with good performance

2. **Google Calendar OAuth**
   - **Risk**: Complex authentication flow, token management
   - **Mitigation**: Leverage existing OAuth implementation, comprehensive testing

3. **AI Feature Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Over-engineering, poor user experience
   - **Mitigation**: Start with MVP, iterate based on user feedback

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **EmailJS Template Management**
   - **Risk**: Template synchronization between dashboard and code
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, version control for template IDs

2. **Performance Impact**
