# 1) Executive Summary
This document outlines the backend development plan for Sunnyside, a social planning application. The backend will be a FastAPI application using MongoDB Atlas for the database, designed to support the features implemented in the existing frontend.

The plan adheres to the specified constraints:
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.12), async.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas with Motor and Pydantic v2.
- **No Docker.**
- **Testing:** Manual testing through the frontend.
- **Git:** Single `main` branch workflow.
- **API:** Base path `/api/v1/*`.

The development is broken down into a dynamic number of sprints, starting with environment setup and progressively adding features like authentication, activity management, and guest handling to match the frontend's capabilities.

# 2) In-scope & Success Criteria
- **In-scope:**
  - User onboarding and account management.
  - Full activity creation and management lifecycle (from idea to finalization).
  - Guest invitation and response flow.
  - Weather-based planning suggestions (mocked initially).
  - AI-powered activity recommendations (mocked initially).
- **Success criteria:**
  - All frontend features are fully supported by the backend.
  - Each sprint's deliverables pass manual UI-driven tests.
  - The backend is successfully deployed and connected to the frontend.
  - Code is pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub after each successful sprint.

# 3) API Design
- **Conventions:**
  - Base path: `/api/v1`.
  - Errors will return a consistent JSON object: `{"detail": "Error message"}`.
- **Endpoints:**

    - `GET /api/v1/activities/{activity_id}`: Get a single activity.
      - **Response:** `Activity`
    - `PUT /api/v1/activities/{activity_id}`: Update an activity (e.g., add weather data, invitees).
      - **Request:** Partial `Activity` object.
      - **Response:** The updated activity object.

  - **Invitations & Responses**
    - `POST /api/v1/activities/{activity_id}/invite`: Send invitations.
      - **Request:** `{ "invitees": [{"name": "string", "email": "string"}], "customMessage": "string" }`
      - **Response:** `{ "message": "Invitations sent" }`
    - `POST /api/v1/invites/{invite_id}/respond`: Submit a response (for guests).
      - **Request:** `{ "response": "string", "availabilityNote": "string", "preferences": {}, "venueSuggestion": "string" }`
      - **Response:** `{ "message": "Response submitted" }`
    - `GET /api/v1/invites/{invite_id}`: Get activity details for a guest.
      - **Response:** `Activity` (public version with limited info)

- **`CreateActivity.tsx`**
  - **Purpose:** Initial activity creation using a chat-like interface.
  - **Backend:** `POST /api/v1/activities`. Creates a new document in the `activities` collection.
- **`WeatherPlanning.tsx`**
  - **Purpose:** Select potential dates based on mock weather data.
  - **Backend:** `PUT /api/v1/activities/{activity_id}` to update the activity with selected days.
- **`InviteGuests.tsx`**
  - **Purpose:** Add invitees and send invitations.
  - **Backend:** `PUT /api/v1/activities/{activity_id}` to add invitees to the activity document.

  - **Purpose:** Allow non-registered users to respond to an invitation.
  - **Backend:** `GET /api/v1/invites/{invite_id}` to fetch activity details and `POST /api/v1/invites/{invite_id}/respond` to save the response. Updates the embedded invitee document in the `activities` collection.

# 6) Configuration & ENV Vars (core only)
- `APP_ENV`: `development`
- `PORT`: `8000`
- `MONGODB_URI`: `mongodb+srv://sunnyside_db_user:GCWkLShMGwJtwNTD@cluster0.rskmhym.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
- `JWT_SECRET`: A long, random string for signing JWTs.
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: `3600` (1 hour)
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: The frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

# 9) Testing Strategy (Manual via Frontend)
- **Policy:** All backend functionality will be tested manually by interacting with the connected frontend. The browser's developer tools (Network tab) will be used to inspect API requests and responses.
- **Per-sprint Manual Test Checklist (Frontend):** Each sprint will include a checklist of UI actions to perform to validate the implemented backend features.
- **User Test Prompt:** A short, clear prompt will be provided for a non-technical user to test the functionality of each sprint.
- **Post-sprint:** If all tests pass, the code will be committed and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.
