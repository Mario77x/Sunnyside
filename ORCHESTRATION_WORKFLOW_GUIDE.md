# Orchestration Workflow Guide

## 1. A Systematic Approach to Complex Problem Resolution

This guide outlines the systematic approach used to resolve the complex deployment challenges encountered during the Google Calendar integration project. This workflow is designed to be a reusable template for future technical challenges, ensuring a structured and efficient resolution process.

## 2. Mode Delegation Strategy and Coordination

The successful resolution of the deployment issues was a result of a coordinated effort between different specialized modes. The following is a summary of the mode delegation strategy:

- **Architect Mode**: The Architect mode was responsible for the initial planning, investigation, and documentation of the problem. This included identifying the root cause of the deployment failures and defining the scope of the required fixes.

- **Code Mode**: The Code mode was responsible for implementing the required code changes, including the refactoring of the `RiskAssessmentService` to use a lazy initialization pattern.

- **Debug Mode**: The Debug mode was responsible for identifying and terminating the zombie process that was blocking port 8000.

- **Orchestrator Mode**: The Orchestrator mode was responsible for coordinating the efforts of the other modes, ensuring a seamless transition between the different phases of the resolution process.

## 3. Best Practices for Multi-Phase Technical Challenges

The following best practices were identified during this project and are recommended for future multi-phase technical challenges:

- **Clear Handoffs**: Ensure that there are clear and concise handoffs between the different modes, with all relevant information and context being transferred.
- **Regular Check-ins**: Conduct regular check-ins to ensure that all modes are aligned and that the project is on track.
- **Centralized Documentation**: Maintain a centralized repository of documentation, including all findings, decisions, and implementation details.

## 4. Template for Future Orchestration Tasks

This workflow can be used as a template for future orchestration tasks. The following is a high-level overview of the recommended steps:

1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly define the problem and the desired outcome.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the problem.
3. **Planning**: Develop a detailed plan for resolving the problem, including a clear delegation of tasks to the appropriate modes.
4. **Implementation**: Execute the plan, with regular check-ins to ensure that the project is on track.
5. **Verification**: Thoroughly test the solution to ensure that the problem has been resolved and that there are no unintended side effects.
6. **Documentation**: Document the entire process, including the problem, the solution, and the lessons learned.
